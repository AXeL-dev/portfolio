    Some years ago jQuery was a solid solution in developing cross-browser applications and providing some fancy DOM manipulations. Things have changed a lot since then and vanilla JS has been evolving steadily. Same story with browsers since Internet Explorer mostly has turned the page too. I know jQuery dev team is moving towards their 3rd major release but i have to admit that i have been using the library even less in my projects.

    The truth is that the nature of applications has changed. My views are connected with my data so i do not need anymore plain DOM manipulations. Now these are part of the whole UI functionality and my data flow and not the result of a key stroke. So i need sth stronger than a listener to a click event that's why i use frameworks like AngularJS and lately VueJS and PolymerJS.

    New ECMAScript versions bring steadily even more goodies for us. New apis like <span class="bold-text">fetch()</span> shall help us run AJAX requests lightning fast. Many people still use jQuery because of the <span class="bold-text">$.ajax()</span> function but since a native alternative will gain ground i guess this shall end.
</p>
<p class="mgt-10">
    Vanilla js offers tons of neat selectors like <span class="bold-text">document.querySelector('myID');</span> or <span class="bold-text">document.getElementById('myID');</span> so there is no need for <span class="bold-text">$('#myID');</span> etc. I know many developers are quite experienced in using jQuery selectors and tend to ignore the vanilla js ways. In fact there are too many developers who feel that they would step outside of their comfort zone if they were asked to use the vanilla js alternatives. The truth is that most of the times vanilla js selectors cover our needs.

<p class="mgt-10">
    As time goes by, the most popular JS frameworks are opting to use vanilla JS instead of JQuery. In fact, the only popular JS frameworks still using JQuery are EmberJS and BackboneJS but the flow is moving away from jQuery.
