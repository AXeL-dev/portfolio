**Short definition:**

A front-end developer deals primarily with the outside appearance of a website—its virtual curb appeal. The back-end developer, on the other hand, is more concerned with the structure and the ‘guts’ of it.

Now that you have a basic understanding of the main priorities of each position, let’s take a brief look at front-end versus back-end development. 

**➤ Languages for Front End Development:**

As a Front-End Developer, you need to learn at least three languages:

- HTML – For Markup
- CSS – For Styling and design
- JavaScript – For Functionality

**➤ Languages for Back End Development:**

When it comes to choosing a back-end language, the most popular choices are:

- Java
- SQL
- PHP
- Python
- Ruby
- C#

**So, which side is better?**

It all depends on you, if you like logical reflection & problems solving maybe the backend development is your jackpot, or if you feel more comfortable with the UI (**U**ser **I**nterface) & design then go for the frontend side. You can even choose to be a full-stack developer by doing both of frontend & backend programming 👍.

*In my case, after spending many years focusing on backend development, i started leaning towards frontend development & ideology for 2 main reasons, the 1st one is that frontend technologies are evolving fast i mean really fast, & the 2nd is that you'll find a wider variety of open-source frameworks & libraries to choose from which gives you more freedom & passion 🔥.*
