I have recently been often asked about animes that worth watching, & since i'm a huge fan of japanese animation, i decided to write this article so i can easily share this list with anyone that may ask me about that in the future üòÅ.

So here we go, below is the list of the top 10 must-see animes (in my humble opinion):

**1**. [Attack on Titan](https://www.google.com/search?q=Attack+on+Titan).

**2**. [Parasyte](https://www.google.com/search?q=Parasyte).

**3**. [Erased](https://www.google.com/search?q=Erased).

**4**. [The Promised Neverland](https://www.google.com/search?q=The+Promised+Neverland).

**5**. [Vinland Saga](https://www.google.com/search?q=Viland+Saga).

**6**. [Demon Slayer](https://www.google.com/search?q=Demon+Slayer).

**7**. [Haikyuu!!](https://www.google.com/search?q=Haikyuu!!).

**8**. [Sword Art Online](https://www.google.com/search?q=Sword+Art+Online).

**9**. [Sing ¬´ Yesterday ¬ª for Me](https://www.google.com/search?q=Yesterday+wo+Utatte).

**10**. [Your Lie in April](https://www.google.com/search?q=Your+Lie+in+April).

You might have noticed that some popular titles are not in the list, but that's totally normal, since this list is not based on animes rating or popularity, but mainly on my own ranking & preferences.
