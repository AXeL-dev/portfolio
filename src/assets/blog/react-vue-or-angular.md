One of the questions that may come up to your mind when reading the title of this post is: Why Angular is listed at the end? If so, i highly encourage you to continue reading the post till the end hoping that you'll find the magic answer 😉

To debate this widely asked question: **React, Vue or Angular?** i'll not use statistics or compare popularity, none of that! i'll simply use some math & magic! Math is enough in fact.., so i've prepared a suite of relevant questions that i will answer in order to get a winner depending on the number of points obtained by each candidate. Got it? Let's begin! 🏁

**Note**: All the answers below come from my own experiences, if you have a different opinion leave it in the comments 💬 so we can discuss it.

**Total Points**:                         |   6   |  7  |   7     | 

Since we have an equality, let's add a last question to get the final winner:

 Question                                 | React | Vue | Angular | Notes
------------------------------------------|-------|-----|---------|--------------------------------------------------
Backed by a great team/company?           |   ✔   |  ✗  |   ✔     | React by Facebook & Angular by Google.
**Final Points**:                         |   7   |  7  |   8     | 

<br>

And the winner is: ... **Angular** 🎉 👑 (**M**agic or **M**ath? 🙄).

Honestly, Vue is great but still less sophisticated, & React is super popular but for some reason i got stuck on the documentation when i first tried it.. I hope to not experience that again if ever i wanted to give it a second try.

In the end, every framework or library has its own pros & cons, so just make a choice & once you feel unsatisfied you can switch it easily 💡
