It have been a while that i didn't work on [Distract Me Not](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/distract-me-not/), one of my "quite successful" web-extensions, mainly because i was occupied on other projects ðŸ‘€, in addition that it has an outdated source code, which makes it not easy to maintain.

So, here we go again, version 2 is coming soon! with some cool new features & a redesigned interface!

Below are the main changes:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) for the frontend: I decided to rework the frontend part because it's kind of old & doesn't look fancy. For that i choosed to go with React instead of Angular this time for simplicity & because React eco-system has much more ready-to-use components & UI libraries.
- [Evergreen](https://evergreen.segment.com/) for the UI.
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for unit tests: Yeah, i'm finally planning to add some unit tests & i think that Jest is one of the best options out there.

I'm also planning to improve the url detection mechanism & to fix the remaining issues on the [issue tracker page](https://github.com/AXeL-dev/distract-me-not/issues).

Finally, here are some previews of the new UI:
