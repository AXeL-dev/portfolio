Without long introductions, let's quickly discover some of the best [Drag n'drop](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_draganddrop.asp) libraries in React, & go through their advantages and disadvantages.

> <h4>dnd kit</h4>

By far the best drag-n-drop library that i used on React till now.

**Pros:**

- Modern
- Lightweight
- Performant
- Extensible

**Cons:**

- The documentation doesn't yet cover everything in details & doesn't provide enough code examples, but that's normal, since the library is quite recent.

> <h4>react-dnd</h4>

This is probably the second best choice when it comes to dnd in React.

**Pros:**

- Full-featured
- Well documented
- Well maintained

**Cons:**

- I noticed few issues when using the library, like when dragging & dropping an element outside of the allowed drop zone, the element disappears & doesn't reappear until you move the mouse once again (this might be related to issues on the browser).

> <h4>react-beautiful-dnd</h4>

Another popular Drag & Drop library by the [atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/) team (the creators of [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira)).

**Pros:**

- Easy to use
- Very popular
- Accessible
- Performant

**Cons:**

- Not applicable/useful in all cases, since it's mainly usable on lists.

There is for sure other libraries out there that i didn't talk about & new libraries that may show up in the future, but for now, i prefer to stick with those 3 since they greatly do the job.
