    GitHub is by far the most popular way to build and share software. That said, one weakness of the platform is that it limits who can create private repositories – that is, software projects that aren’t visible to the broader public, and are shared only with a handful of pre-defined collaborators – to paying users.

    Fortunately, that’s no longer the case, as GitHub today announced it was <a href="https://blog.github.com/2019-01-07-new-year-new-github/" target="_blank">giving users of its free plan access to unlimited private repositories</a>. This is great news for GitHub’s users, but there is a caveat, of course.

<p class="mgt-10">
    Private repositories on free accounts are limited to three collaborators apiece. So, while this might work for a small project (like, for example, a team competing in a hackathon), it isn’t particularly well-suited for actual commercial usage.
