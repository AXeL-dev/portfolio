                As a web developer i was really struggling to choose which front-end technology to work with, especially since there are thousands of javascript libraries & frameworks, and honnestly choose among all these libraries is not that easy (every library has benefits & cons).
            </p>
            <p class="mgt-10">
                So i first started with <a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> which <b>was</b> really popular, known by its simplicity & easy to use API, having a large amount of plugins to choose from, i really liked it! Then, arrives the jQuery fall! jQuery was loosing performance especially with the new versions of web browsers & was outdated somehow, in addition that some developers write "spaghetti code" with jquery (i don't do like so üôÑ, don't trust me xD), and that gave the opportunity to the new generation of frameworks & libraries to take more place on the market.
            </p>
            <p class="mgt-10">
                I still remember when i first heard about <b>Angular</b>, <b>Backbone.js</b> & <b>Ember.js</b>, i was so curious to know what they have to offer but i never had time or ambition to satisfy my curiosity. Time passed & then i decided to start at least with Angular, i tried Angular 2 which i found great but not so easy to master (need a lot of time & practice). I decided then to look at <b>React</b> which was more simpler somehow but wasn't enough convincing... Okay, till here my last choice was <b>Vue.js</b> right? but i didn't try to look at it! üòÖ, i thought that it was like the others & i said: "okay, let's wait until i get a job position then i'll choose depending on the job prerequisites."
            </p>
            <p class="mgt-10">
                I also tried some other libraries like <a href="https://riot.js.org/">RiotJS</a> (which i used on my portfolio by the way) & <a href="https://preactjs.com/">Preact</a> (which seems to be a pretty good alternative for React), but they wasn't enough powerful/feature-rich even if they was easy to learn & use.
            </p>
            <p class="mgt-10">
                Once i had a job, i was disappointed üòû because they wasn't caring about the used technologies more than the results.. In addition that we was mainly working on some old open source projects which certainly use old technologies.. Days passed and i finally got a front-end project to work on! the project was mainly written in AnuglarJS (the 1st & old version of Angular) & was doing some calls to an API to retrieve data, so i started learning <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a>! it was really simple (compared to the others), in less than a week i was able to understand the whole code of the project & in the next week the modifications on the project was done! <b>Happy end!</b> don't you think so? in fact, no.. AngularJS was outdated since Angular 2++ took his place, so continuing to use such a library may be only a waste of time & effort.
            </p>
            <p class="mgt-10">
                Then comes the day when i decided to look at <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue.js</a>, i was so impressed how much it was similiar to both AngularJS & React, in fact Vue is practically a merge between Angular & React with a simple advantage that there is no restrictions about the way you want to write your code, so if you are an Angular developer you can still use the old way of AngularJS & if you are coming from the React world you might use the ES2015 syntax & the JSX power. That's just <b>awesome</b> & <b>lovely</b>!

                Well.. this is a big discussion subject but i'll try to be short & focus on the points i wanna talk about.

            <p class="mgt-10">
                So.. it have been 2 years now or maybe a little more since i'm doing some freelancing tasks & compared to my previous jobs career "especially in my country" i could say that i was <b>a loser</b>.. okay, so why am i saying this? what's the point?
            </p>
            <p class="mgt-10">
                The point is if you don't work hard to achieve your dreams, someone else will hire you to achieve theirs. And when it comes to dreams they could ask you to build a plane while you don't even know how to build a car.. You get me, right?
            </p>
            <p class="mgt-10">
                Okay..! so what's the benefits of freelance:
            </p>
            <ul class="disc-list mgt-10">
                <li><b>You can work at your own pace</b> == ! stress and ! hard deadlines</li>
                <li><b>You are free</b> to choose/accept the project(s) you want to work on/you feel interested about</li>
                <li><b>You can & will do/learn much things</b> (your time is yours)</li>
                <li><b>No protocols, no headaches, no wars..</b></li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mgt-10">
                Cool! what about the cons? yup, there are always some:
            </p>
            <ul class="disc-list mgt-10">
                <li><b>No guarantee</b> (it's not easy to find some tasks or projects to work on, unless you have some experience)</li>
                <li><b>Laziness</b>, wasting time sleeping or doing nothing.. (yeah i know.. so just do something ! doing some sports, yoga or any kind of activity could help)</li>
                <li><b>Depression</b>: if you feel depressed while working/being alone, it's totally normal, we "humans" are social by nature --', so just talk to someone (even if you keep talking to yourself ^^')</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mgt-10">
                All this said, only you could define if you'll be a successful or an unsuccessful freelancer, the same as, only you can decide to be a good or bad person.. so even if you have no significant experience(s), just carry on, find some projects to work on, there is a plenty of open source projects & opportunities waiting for you out there, and show your know-how & passion to the world !

                Web development is a diverse and ever-changing landscape. New tools and technologies are emerging regularly, making developers face a dilemma: whether to choose long-standing and mature solutions or to give newcomers a try.
            </p>
            <p class="mgt-10">
                Back-end developers often deal with a problem of choosing between Node.js and PHP. This has become a common question lately, though earlier JavaScript, which underlies Node.js, didn‚Äôt overlap with PHP. JavaScript built front-end applications, while PHP was used for server-side development. Working together, these two languages created dynamic websites.
            </p>
            <p class="mgt-10">
                Why did the situation change? This happened because JS represented by a new Node.js started entering a server-side sphere and distract back-end developers from old-fashioned PHP.

                It is quite difficult to choose a winner in PHP or Node.js on the basis of their features and advantages. It would be better to build different test cases for them and carry them out against a benchmark on the same machine.

                In spite of all the advantages and disadvantages, there‚Äôs still no ubiquitous answer as to the best solution. The technology for each backend project should be chosen individually on the basis of its specific features.

                Disadvantages
            </p>
            <p class="mgt-10">
                Moreover, after all the positive remarks about Magento, there are some tiny disadvantages that make people hesitant about choosing Magento CMS. Compared to other CMS, Magento is more expensive. With other CMS brands, you will have to pay less every month. Since Magento offers more benefits, it comes with a price.
            </p>
            <p class="mgt-10">
                Futhermore, Magento CMS takes a longer time to develop. Magento has a complex infrastructure that will require time to set up. Rome wasn‚Äôt built in a day. All good things take longer to develop. Magento also takes gigabytes to process. It takes up a lot of RAM. Magento is written in PHP, sometimes it cannot handle the load. This process delays and takes up more space. Another small disadvantage is that whenever Magento goes down, so will all your sites. Hence at times, your site will not function properly and it won‚Äôt be under your control.
            </p>
            <p class="bold-text mgt-10">
                Conclusion

            <p class="mgt-10">
                Regardless of its cons, the pros cancel the cons out. Hence, Magento received the most public demand out of all eCommerce platforms in 2018. Magento CMS is a different take from the rest of the crowd. They offer benefits which other platforms are unable to offer.
            </p>
            <p class="mgt-10">
                All the advantages add up to be the best CMS there is on the market. So, you cannot possibly compare with any other CMS. If anyone who has previously used Magento knows how much sales you can make through Magento. And better sales should be the motive of any eCommerce site.

            <p>
                Some years ago jQuery was a solid solution in developing cross-browser applications and providing some fancy DOM manipulations. Things have changed a lot since then and vanilla JS has been evolving steadily. Same story with browsers since Internet Explorer mostly has turned the page too. I know jQuery dev team is moving towards their 3rd major release but i have to admit that i have been using the library even less in my projects.
            </p>
            <p class="mgt-10">
                The truth is that the nature of applications has changed. My views are connected with my data so i do not need anymore plain DOM manipulations. Now these are part of the whole UI functionality and my data flow and not the result of a key stroke. So i need sth stronger than a listener to a click event that's why i use frameworks like AngularJS and lately VueJS and PolymerJS.
            </p>
            <p class="mgt-10">
                New ECMAScript versions bring steadily even more goodies for us. New apis like <span class="bold-text">fetch()</span> shall help us run AJAX requests lightning fast. Many people still use jQuery because of the <span class="bold-text">$.ajax()</span> function but since a native alternative will gain ground i guess this shall end.
            </p>
            <p class="mgt-10">
                Vanilla js offers tons of neat selectors like <span class="bold-text">document.querySelector('myID');</span> or <span class="bold-text">document.getElementById('myID');</span> so there is no need for <span class="bold-text">$('#myID');</span> etc. I know many developers are quite experienced in using jQuery selectors and tend to ignore the vanilla js ways. In fact there are too many developers who feel that they would step outside of their comfort zone if they were asked to use the vanilla js alternatives. The truth is that most of the times vanilla js selectors cover our needs.
            </p>
            <p class="mgt-10">
                As time goes by, the most popular JS frameworks are opting to use vanilla JS instead of JQuery. In fact, the only popular JS frameworks still using JQuery are EmberJS and BackboneJS but the flow is moving away from jQuery.

            <p class="mgt-10">
                I've been working on Dolibarr for almost 3 years now and here is what i think about it.
            </p>
            <p class="mgt-10">
                Let's start with the good part:
            </p>
            <ul class="disc-list mgt-10">
                <li><span class="bold-text">Free & opensource</span> (even if the most of external modules are paid)</li>
                <li class="bold-text">Simple installation</li>
                <li class="bold-text">Ergonomic & user friendly interface</li>
                <li class="bold-text">Extensible & customisable</li>
                <li><span class="bold-text">Growing audience</span> (dolibarr is widely used in some countries like France & Greece)</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mgt-10">
                The worst part:
            </p>
            <ul class="disc-list mgt-10">
                <li><span class="bold-text">Bugs</span> (you can easily discover a bug just by playing with your browser address bar)</li>
                <li><span class="bold-text">Spaghetti code</span> (no wonder why there is so much bugs..)</li>
                <li><span class="bold-text">Poor documentation</span> (developer documentation is really old & outdated)</li>
                <li><span class="bold-text">Slow development</span> (even if dolibarr has seen very good changes in the last years)</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mgt-10">
                As a conclusion, i can say that a full-rewrite of dolibarr using some new web technologies is maybe needed to get a clean & easy to understand base code. Also, providing a good documentation is fundamental, especially for beginners.

                GitHub is by far the most popular way to build and share software. That said, one weakness of the platform is that it limits who can create private repositories ‚Äì that is, software projects that aren‚Äôt visible to the broader public, and are shared only with a handful of pre-defined collaborators ‚Äì to paying users.

                Fortunately, that‚Äôs no longer the case, as GitHub today announced it was <a href="https://blog.github.com/2019-01-07-new-year-new-github/" target="_blank">giving users of its free plan access to unlimited private repositories</a>. This is great news for GitHub‚Äôs users, but there is a caveat, of course.

            <p class="mgt-10">
                Private repositories on free accounts are limited to three collaborators apiece. So, while this might work for a small project (like, for example, a team competing in a hackathon), it isn‚Äôt particularly well-suited for actual commercial usage.
