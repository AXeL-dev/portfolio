    <a href="https://riot.js.org/" target="_blank">Riot</a> is a frontend javascript library that lets you build user interfaces with custom tags using simple and enjoyable syntax. It uses a virtual DOM similar to React but faster. <span class="bold-text">Riot</span> is very tiny compared to <a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank">React</a> or <a href="https://www.polymer-project.org/" target="_blank">Polymer</a>.

    As a developer one of the main problems i face with new technologies is the significant learning curve with no guarantee that you will find some projects to work on with what you just learned, so you may be just wasting time on learning something you won't use.
    This is why i'm trying to be more consistent when it comes to choices & this is why i chose Riot ;)
