    <a href="https://www.dolibarr.org/" target="_blank">Dolibarr</a> is an opensource and free software package to manage companies, freelancers or foundations. It's basically a web application coded in javascript & PHP that you can use to handle your business on a local or remote server.

    I've been working on Dolibarr for almost 3 years now and here is what i think about it.
</p>
<p class="mgt-10">
    Let's start with the good part:
</p>
<ul class="disc-list mgt-10">
    <li><span class="bold-text">Free & opensource</span> (even if the most of external modules are paid)</li>
    <li class="bold-text">Simple installation</li>
    <li class="bold-text">Ergonomic & user friendly interface</li>
    <li class="bold-text">Extensible & customisable</li>
    <li><span class="bold-text">Growing audience</span> (dolibarr is widely used in some countries like France & Greece)</li>
</ul>
<p class="mgt-10">
    The worst part:
</p>
<ul class="disc-list mgt-10">
    <li><span class="bold-text">Bugs</span> (you can easily discover a bug just by playing with your browser address bar)</li>
    <li><span class="bold-text">Spaghetti code</span> (no wonder why there is so much bugs..)</li>
    <li><span class="bold-text">Poor documentation</span> (developer documentation is really old & outdated)</li>
    <li><span class="bold-text">Slow development</span> (even if dolibarr has seen very good changes in the last years)</li>
</ul>
<p class="mgt-10">
    As a conclusion, i can say that a full-rewrite of dolibarr using some new web technologies is maybe needed to get a clean & easy to understand base code. Also, providing a good documentation is fundamental, especially for beginners.
