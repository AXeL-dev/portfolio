Have been using Linux for more than 6 years so far, i tried many different distributions & desktop environments, & honestly it wasn't that easy to stick with a specific distro at first, the reason why i thought to write this article & give my personal opinion/preferences when it comes to Linux.

So, when talking about Linux, there are 2 main parts or let's call them components that we need to know about. The first & main component is the Linux distribution **Core** & the remaining component is the **Desktop Environment** (abbreviated to **DE**) or more simply the UI part.

Therefore, i'll be first showing some of the most popular DEs then giving examples of distributions where they come pre built-in.

> <h4>Budgie Desktop</h4>

By far my prefered DE. It's a fork of Gnome but it aims to be more simple & lightweight. Budgie is available on:

- [Ubuntu Budgie](https://ubuntubudgie.org/)
- [Solus OS](https://getsol.us/home/)

> <h4>Deepin Desktop Environment (or DDE)</h4>

![deepin-desktop](./assets/img/posts/linux-DE/deepin-desktop.jpg)

Probably the most beautiful Linux Desktop Environment of this collection. DDE is available on:

- [Deepin OS](https://www.deepin.org/en/)
- [Ubuntu DDE](https://ubuntudde.com/)

> <h4>Pantheon</h4>

![pantheon](./assets/img/posts/linux-DE/pantheon.jpg)

The most similar DE to MAC OS user interface. Pantheon is mainly available on [Elementary OS](https://elementary.io/en/).

> <h4>Gnome</h4>

![gnome](./assets/img/posts/linux-DE/gnome.jpg)

A so popular & evolutive DE. You can find Gnome on many distros like:

- [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com)
- [Zorin OS](https://zorinos.com/)
- [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/en/)

> <h4>XFCE</h4>

![xfce](./assets/img/posts/linux-DE/xfce.jpg)

The most lightweight Desktop Environment that i've tested so far. XFCE is available on:

- [Xubuntu](https://xubuntu.org/)
- [Manjaro Linux](https://manjaro.org/)
- [Linux Lite](https://www.linuxliteos.com/)

> <h4>KDE</h4>

![kde](./assets/img/posts/linux-DE/kde.jpg)

Probably the most complete & full-featured DE out there. You can find KDE on:

- [Kubuntu](https://kubuntu.org/)
- [KDE Neon](https://neon.kde.org/)

As a last word/advice, i highly recommend you to stick with a [Ubuntu flavor](https://ubuntu.com/download/flavours) due to the huge community that stands behind Ubuntu, so even if you end up with unexpected issues, you'ld probably find help/solutions a way faster than if you were on any other Linux distribution.
