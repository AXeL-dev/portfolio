This is just a short "funny" story that happened to me, but before going more deeper into this, i hope that you'll take the time to think about the question before you continue reading.

Okay, so that was one of the questions i was asked on a job interview & since it was tricky, i just escaped the question & said: none of them 🙄, but the funny thing here, is that when i asked about the answer at the end of the interview i was launghing on myself 🤭 'cause in the end the answer isn't that hard to find, and to explain it in a simple way, let's answer some questions:
- what a lion does when it's on a jungle? he's the most of time offensive & everyone is scared of him since it's considered as a king (right?)
- okay, what about the hedgehog? well.., he might be shy & fearful but when it comes to self-defense he's persistent & got some strong weapons! 🛡️

Good, now let's imagine that a fight ⚔️ has started between Mr. L & Mr. H, who will be the winner in your opinion? of course the lion, come on!..

Well, the answer is no! since the lion won't win against the hedgehog thorns.. 👀

Yeah, that's it, so what do you think now, do you still prefer to be a lion? 😛 Let me know in the comment section below :)
