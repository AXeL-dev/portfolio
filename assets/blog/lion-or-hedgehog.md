This is just a short "funny" story that happened to me, so before going more deeper into this, i hope that you'll take the time to think about & answer the question before you continue reading.

Okay, so that was one of the questions i was asked on a job interview & since it was tricky, i just answered: none of them 👀 (power of neutrality 🙄), but the funny thing here, is that when i got the answer to the question 🤭 i was launghing on myself 'cause in the end the answer isn't that hard to find, and to explain it in a simple way, let's answer some questions:
- what a lion does when it's on a jungle? he's most of time surly & everyone is scared of him since it's considered as a king (right?)
- okay, what about the hedgehog? well.., he might be shy & fearful but when it comes to self-defense he's persistent & got some strong weapons! 🛡️

& if ever a fight fires between those 2 ⚔️, the lion won't win against the hedgehog thorns..

So, what do you think now after hearing the answer, do you still prefer to be a lion? 😛 Let me know in the comment section below :)
