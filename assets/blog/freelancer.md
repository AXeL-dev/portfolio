    Well.. this is a big discussion subject but i'll try to be short & focus on the points i wanna talk about.
</p>
<p class="mgt-10">
    So.. it have been 2 years now or maybe a little more since i'm doing some freelancing tasks & compared to my previous jobs career "especially in my country" i could say that i was <b>a loser</b>.. okay, so why am i saying this? what's the point?
</p>
<p class="mgt-10">
    The point is if you don't work hard to achieve your dreams, someone else will hire you to achieve theirs. And when it comes to dreams they could ask you to build a plane while you don't even know how to build a car.. You get me, right?
</p>
<p class="mgt-10">
    Okay..! so what's the benefits of freelance:
</p>
<ul class="disc-list mgt-10">
    <li><b>You can work at your own pace</b> == ! stress and ! hard deadlines</li>
    <li><b>You are free</b> to choose/accept the project(s) you want to work on/you feel interested about</li>
    <li><b>You can & will do/learn much things</b> (your time is yours)</li>
    <li><b>No protocols, no headaches, no wars..</b></li>
</ul>
<p class="mgt-10">
    Cool! what about the cons? yup, there are always some:
</p>
<ul class="disc-list mgt-10">
    <li><b>No guarantee</b> (it's not easy to find some tasks or projects to work on, unless you have some experience)</li>
    <li><b>Laziness</b>, wasting time sleeping or doing nothing.. (yeah i know.. so just do something ! doing some sports, yoga or any kind of activity could help)</li>
    <li><b>Depression</b>: if you feel depressed while working/being alone, it's totally normal, we "humans" are social by nature --', so just talk to someone (even if you keep talking to yourself ^^')</li>
</ul>
<p class="mgt-10">
    All this said, only you could define if you'll be a successful or an unsuccessful freelancer, the same as, only you can decide to be a good or bad person.. so even if you have no significant experience(s), just carry on, find some projects to work on, there is a plenty of open source projects & opportunities waiting for you out there, and show your know-how & passion to the world !
