One of the biggest downsides to choose Linux as an operating system for daily usage is maybe its lack of handy & user friendly softwares, yes..

Still this has heavily changed during the last years, as we saw many apps joining the Linux world & bringing more joy to it, thanks to [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) & cross-platform libraries!

Today, we're going to discover **Emote**, a modern & easy to use emoji picker crafted for Linux:

### Installation

The main way to install Emote, is using the snap package available on [snapcraft.io](https://snapcraft.io/emote) or via the following command line:

```bash
sudo snap install emote
```

> If your distribution does not support snap packages, you can manually build the app & install it by following the instructions under [the official Github repository](https://github.com/tom-james-watson/Emote#development).

### Usage

Emote runs in the background and automatically starts when you log in.

The emoji picker can be opened with either the keyboard shortcut or by clicking the app icon again.

> To open Emote via keyboard shortcut, use: **Ctrl+Alt+E** (which can be changed under the settings).

Well, that's it, enjoy your brand new emoji picker!

Linux sweet Linux.. 😍
