During one of my recent projects development, i ended up using a virtual machine to test the communication between a mailing server & my nodejs API.
For that purpose, i needed first to create a VM & then setup a shared network so both my machine & the VM can communicate with each others, & since i went through many solutions before finding the right one, i decided to share some of the knowledge i gained during this little experiment.

I won't go through the steps to install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/), but you can simply try to follow any [tutorial](https://www.google.com/search?q=install+virtualbox) online if you need to.

Starting from this point, i'm assuming you already have installed VirtualBox & also created a virtual machine which can be a Linux distribution or even a Windows OS.

So, let's see how you can setup a shared network in VirtualBox:

<br>

### 1. Setup the NAT Adapter

First, go to your VM settings, then **Network**, & then go to the **Adapter 1** tab & choose **NAT** in the **Attached to** field, and finally hit `save/ok`.

**Note**: If you are not able to edit your machine settings, you probably need to turn it off first.

Now, if you turn on your virtual machine you should be able to:

- Access the internet.

- Connect to the Host machine on the **10.0.2.2** IP address. To test it you can simply open a terminal on your VM & type:

```bash
ping 10.0.2.2
```

### 2. Setup port forwarding

In case you want to get access to the local network of your Guest machine (VM) from the Host machine, you'll need to setup the port forwarding, which simply consists of forwarding the Guest machine ports to the Host machine.

Therefore, let's go back to the VM settings, **Network** section & open the **Advanced** settings collapse under the **Adapter 1** tab then click on the **Port Forwarding** button.

Next, let's setup the port forwarding rules, for example, if you want to forward the port 80 from your Guest machine (VM) to your Host machine you need to add the following rule:

![port-forwarding](./assets/img/posts/virtualbox/port-forwarding.png)

**To know:**
- The Host IP address would always be **127.0.0.1**.
- You can get the Guest/VM IP address by opening a terminal & typing **ifconfig** command on Linux, or **ipconfig** command on Windows.
- & of course you can do the same manipulation with any other port.

**Note**: You can also get the Guest machine IP address from the bottom panel of your VM window, by hovering on the network icon as below:

![network-popup](./assets/img/posts/virtualbox/network-popup.png)

Once the port forwarding setup is finished, you can go on your Host machine & access the Guest machine using the IP address 127.0.0.1 followed by the port(s) you've forwarded.

That's all i have to mention in this post, i hope you find it useful & in case you have any thoughts or remarks let me know in the comment section below.
