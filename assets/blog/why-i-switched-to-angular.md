If you read my older post about vue.js "<a href="./blog/post/15" target="_blank">I fall in love with vue.js</a>" you may be wondering why did i switch to Angular that fast. Well, this wasn't a simple decision since i've already tried Angular 2 before & i've found it kind of complicate, so why?

Honestly, Vue is just awesome & i really loved the simplicity of that "well documented" framework, but it stills got some lacks.. or in other words, Vue is losing the race against Angular, so let's get more in the details & see how Angular is quite better (in my opinion):

**1.** The [angular-cli](https://cli.angular.io/) is just super helpful & powerful, you can start a new project in just few seconds & you're ready to go/code!

**2.** Angular forces you to use [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) which is one of the best superset of javascript, giving you all those benefits:
- Optional static typing
- Type Inference, which gives some of the benefits of types, without actually using them
- Access to ES6 and ES7 features, before they become supported by major browsers
- The ability to compile down to a version of JavaScript that runs on all browsers
- Great tooling support with IntelliSense

**3.** Easy testing & debugging: Angular mades testing and debugging really easy!

**4.** Fast deployment: Once finished from coding you have to run one simple command (_**ng build**_) & you're done!

**5.** There is a large variety of available modules and packages on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) which will make your life even easier (just search for packages names that start with _**ngx-**_...).

So, what are you waiting?! if you didn't try Angular before, I highly recommend it ðŸ˜‰.
