    As a web developer i was really struggling to choose which front-end technology to work with, especially since there are thousands of javascript libraries & frameworks, and honnestly choose among all these libraries is not that easy (every library has benefits & cons).
</p>
<p class="mgt-10">
    So i first started with <a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> which <b>was</b> really popular, known by its simplicity & easy to use API, having a large amount of plugins to choose from, i really liked it! Then, arrives the jQuery fall! jQuery was loosing performance especially with the new versions of web browsers & was outdated somehow, in addition that some developers write "spaghetti code" with jquery (i don't do like so ðŸ™„, don't trust me xD), and that gave the opportunity to the new generation of frameworks & libraries to take more place on the market.

    I still remember when i first heard about <b>Angular</b>, <b>Backbone.js</b> & <b>Ember.js</b>, i was so curious to know what they have to offer but i never had time or ambition to satisfy my curiosity. Time passed & then i decided to start at least with Angular, i tried Angular 2 which i found great but not so easy to master (need a lot of time & practice). I decided then to look at <b>React</b> which was more simpler somehow but wasn't enough convincing... Okay, till here my last choice was <b>Vue.js</b> right? but i didn't try to look at it! ðŸ˜…, i thought that it was like the others & i said: "okay, let's wait until i get a job position then i'll choose depending on the job prerequisites."

    I also tried some other libraries like <a href="https://riot.js.org/">RiotJS</a> (which i used on my portfolio by the way) & <a href="https://preactjs.com/">Preact</a> (which seems to be a pretty good alternative for React), but they wasn't enough powerful/feature-rich even if they was easy to learn & use.

    Once i had a job, i was disappointed ðŸ˜ž because they wasn't caring about the used technologies more than the results.. In addition that we was mainly working on some old open source projects which certainly use old technologies.. Days passed and i finally got a front-end project to work on! the project was mainly written in AnuglarJS (the 1st & old version of Angular) & was doing some calls to an API to retrieve data, so i started learning <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a>! it was really simple (compared to the others), in less than a week i was able to understand the whole code of the project & in the next week the modifications on the project was done! <b>Happy end!</b> don't you think so? in fact, no.. AngularJS was outdated since Angular 2++ took his place, so continuing to use such a library may be only a waste of time & effort.

    Then comes the day when i decided to look at <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue.js</a>, i was so impressed how much it was similiar to both AngularJS & React, in fact Vue is practically a merge between Angular & React with a simple advantage that there is no restrictions about the way you want to write your code, so if you are an Angular developer you can still use the old way of AngularJS & if you are coming from the React world you might use the ES2015 syntax & the JSX power. That's just <b>awesome</b> & <b>lovely</b>!
